# Vault Java SDK Maven Plugin

This Maven plugin provides an easy to use set of commands to package, validate, import, and deploy Vault Java SDK source code through the use of defined Maven goals.

## Prerequisites
1. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven.

## Configuration

To make the Maven plugin available in a Vault Java SDK project, add the following to the project's pom.xml file. The configuration properties can be set in either the pom.xml or as parameters when running the goals.

Configuration Parameters:    

```
<vaultDNS> - a vault’s DNS host name (e.g. vaulturl.veevavault.com with no HTTPS://)
<username> - the vault user name to use for authentication required for using the import, deploy, and validate goals
<password> - the password for user specified in <username>. As a best practice, input the password through the command line or via an IDE build parameter. Avoid saving the password in the pom.xml file 
<sessionId> - optional, an authenticated live user session id used instead of providing userName/password credentials
<package> - optional, define a custom VPK to deploy. The VPK must exist in '{{PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH}}/deployment/packages'
<packageId> - optional, deploy a specific imported package ID. To be used in conjunction with the vaultjavasdk:import goal. The ID can also be retrieved from the vault UI.
<source> - optional, specify packages or class source files to include in the VPK file; if omitted, all files in the project. This is list of parameters.
	<packages> - comma separated list of package names from the project
	<classes> - comma separated list of fully qualified java file names
	
* In general, you should avoid saving the password in the pom.xml file when possible. 
```

The pom.xml configuration:

	        	</configuration>
        	</plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>    
```

## Maven Goals 

The following goals are provided by the plugin.

* **vaultjavasdk:clean** - removes all files in the “deployment” folder in the maven project. This folder contains VPK files and vaultpackage.xml file created by this plugin. 

* **vaultjavasdk:package** - generates a VPK file in the "deployment/packages" directory. 
    * VPK file name format: code_package_{mm-dd-yyyy}_{num}.vpk
    * If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
    * If a VPK already exists, increment {mm-dd-yyyy} and/or {num} 
    * Source files under the “javasdk/src/main/java/com/veeva/vault/custom” folder in the project are zipped into a VPK file.

* **vaultjavasdk:deploy** - validates, imports, and deploys the last modified VPK in the "deployment/packages" directory it to a vault. This uses the [Validation Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Validate_Code), [Import Package Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Import_Package_Config), and [Deploy Package Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Deploy_Package_Config).

* **vaultjavasdk:validate** - validates the last modified VPK in the "deployment/packages" directory against the [Validation Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Validate_Code).

* **vaultjavasdk:import** - validates and imports the last modified VPK in the "deployment/packages" directory to a vault. **This is optional and is intended for verifying package in Vault Admin UI before deploying via the Vault Admin UI**. This uses the [Validation Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Validate_Code) and [Import Package Endpoint](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/18.3/#Import_Package_Config).


### Notes

1. The **validate**, **import**, and **deploy** goals will pick up the last modified ".vpk" file in the "deployment/packages" folder. This means that you can craft your own custom VPK files provided they are the last modified ".vpk" file in the "deployment/packages" folder.
2. The **package** goal won't replace the "vaultpackage.xml" file in the "deployment" folder. You can modify values in this file to meet your needs.
3. The **package** goal is run separately from the import, deploy, and validate goals. This means that any code changes will require a "vaultjavasdk:package" before running an import, deploy, or validate if you want to pick up the latest code.


## How to run

You can either configure the goals in your IDE or run them directly through the Maven command line. The following example is for running the **clean**, **package**, and then **deploy** goals through the command line when the parameters are not configured in the pom.xml:
* Navigate to your project's base directory (where the pom.xml is located) and execute the following:
   
    > mvn vaultjavasdk:clean vaultjavasdk:package vaultjavasdk:deploy -Dusername=test@user.com -Dpassword=test0000 -DvaultDNS=testurl.veevavault.com
    
### Other Goal Examples

* Custom VPK package

    > mvn vaultjavasdk:deploy -Dpackage=custom_package.vpk -Dusername=test@user.com -Dpassword=test0000 -DvaultDNS=testurl.veevavault.com  
    
* Import and then Deploy

    > mvn vaultjavasdk:import -Dusername=test@user.com -Dpassword=test0000 -DvaultDNS=testurl.veevavault.com  

    > mvn vaultjavasdk:deploy -DpackageId=0PI000000000XXX -Dusername=test@user.com -Dpassword=test0000 -DvaultDNS=testurl.veevavault.com
